# Google Functions Deploy

A node.js CLI that allows users to deploy multiple Google Cloud functions (in separate folders) using a single command.

## Background

A while back, I migrated several cloud functions from Netlify to the Google Cloud platform and noticed that the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud` command) requires that developers issue a separate deployment comment for each function deployment. 

My project had three functions and I wanted a way to deploy all three with a single command. In [Google Cloud Multiple Functions in a Project](https://johnwargo.com/posts/2024/google-cloud-multiple-functions/) I added some code to my project that allowed me to easily do this using [Google zx](https://github.com/google/zx) as an execution helper. 

In an effort to make that code easier to use across multiple project, I decided to make a node-based CLI that allows me to easily execute batch deploying across multiple Google Cloud Functions projects.

To use this module, you install it globally, then add a simple (automatically generated by the module) configuration file to the project folder. With the correct configuration in place, you can deploy all cloud functions in a project folder using a single command. 

## Installation

To install the command, open a terminal window, then execute the following command:

``` shell
npm install -g google-functions-deploy
```

**Note:** You should not need to use `sudo` on linux or macOS to install the module. If you find that you need to or want to, instead go back and fix permissions for your local node.js installation and try it again.

The module adds a `gfdeploy` command you can use in any Google Cloud Functions project to deploy a function or group of functions in a single command - without requiring any command-line parameters.

## Usage

## Configuration

To deploy a Google Cloud function or a group of functions, open a terminal window in the Google Cloud Functions project then execute the following command:

``` shell
gfdeploy
```

The module requires a configuration file, so on first run it will offer to create it for you as shown in the following example:

``` shell
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│                              │
│   Deploy Google Functions    │
│                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘

Configuration path: D:\dev\node\google-functions-deploy\gfdeploy.json

Configuration file missing:
Rather than requiring the use of a bunch of command-line arguments, this tool uses a configuration file instead.
In the next step, the module will automatically create the configuration file for you.
Once it completes, you can edit the configuration file to change the default values and execute the command again.

√ Create configuration file? ... yes
√ Use default flags? ... yes
√ Select one or more function folders to deploy: » Function1, Function2, Function3

Writing configuration file D:\dev\node\google-functions-deploy\gfdeploy.json
Output file written successfully

Open D:\dev\node\google-functions-deploy\gfdeploy.json in an editor to modify configuration settings.
```

If you run the command in a terminal window inside Visual Studio Code, the module will open the file in the editor after creating the file.

You can also skip that process altogether and create the file manually. To do that, create a file in the project root called `gfdeploy.json` and populate it with two JSON arrays: `functionFolders` and `flags` as shown in the example below:

```json
{
  "functionFolders": [],
  "flags": []
}
```

The following table describes each configuration option:

| Configuration Array | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| `functionFolders`   | The array of sub-folders that contain Google Cloud Functions functions. Each folder represents a single function. |
| `flags`             | The array of `gcloud functions deploy` command-line arguments required to successfully deploy the function to Google's cloud platform. The module will automatically populate the function name in the command. |

Here's an example of a configuration file populated with configuration information for three functions (Function1, Function2, and Function3) deployed to `us-east1` using node.js version 20 with an HTTP trigger allowing unauthenticated access:

```json
{
  "functionFolders": [
    "Function1",
    "Function2",
    "Function3"
  ],
  "flags": [
    "--region=us-east1",
    "--runtime=nodejs20",
    "--trigger-http",
    "--allow-unauthenticated"
  ]
}
```

The `gcloud functions deploy` command supports a wide selection of command-line options, refer to the [product documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/functions/deploy) for information about all of the available options. Rather than code support for every command-line option, all you have to do is populate the `flags` array with the appropriate settings for your particular project and the module takes care of passing them to the `gcloud` command.

## Function Deployment

With a populated configuration in place, to deploy all of the functions in a project to Google Cloud Functions, open a terminal window in the project folder and execute the following command:

``` shell
gfdeploy
```

The module will loop through all of the folders in the `functionsFolders` array and execute the deployment command for each while writing all output to the console.
